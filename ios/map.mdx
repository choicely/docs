## Add ChoicelyMap to your project

<Note>
If you haven't added the Choicely SDK to your project yet, please follow the steps in the [Quick start](/ios/quick-start) section.
</Note>

1. Select your target and go to "General" tab. Click the "+" button on "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section and add ChoicelyMap module.

2. ChoicelyMap requires the GoogleMaps SDK to function. Add it as a dependency to your project:
   ```
   https://github.com/googlemaps/ios-maps-sdk.git
   ```

3. Create map API key by following the steps in [How to create map API key](/resources/map-api) section.

4. Just before `ChoicelySDK.initialize(...)` assign your map API key to `ChoicelySDK.settings.mapApiKey` setting:
   ```swift
   ChoicelySDK.settings.mapApiKey = "YOUR_MAP_API_KEY"
   ```

5. That's it! You're now ready to start using ChoicelyMap features in your project.
