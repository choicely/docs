## Features

- **Push Notifications** – Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) allows the app to send push notifications directly to users, helping you keep them engaged with instant updates, news, or alerts.

- **Realtime Updates** – With Firebase Realtime Database, content and configuration changes can be delivered instantly to your users without requiring an app update. This ensures your app always reflects the latest data.

- **Social Login** – The Choicely SDK integrates with Firebase Authentication to enable sign-in with popular providers such as Google, Facebook, and Apple. This makes it easy for users to log in without creating a separate account.

## Add ChoicelyFirebase to your project

<Note>
If you haven't added the Choicely SDK to your project yet, please follow the steps in the [Quick start](/ios/quick-start) section.
</Note>

1. Select your target and go to "General" tab. Click the "+" button on "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section and add `ChoicelyFirebase` module.

2. ChoicelyFirebase depends on the FirebaseUI SDK. Add it to your project as a dependency (version 14.0.0 or later).
   ```
   https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS.git
   ```

   <Note>
   Some FirebaseUI versions may conflict with other dependencies in your project. Please refer to their [release versions and compatibility](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS/releases).
   </Note>

3. Add the next modules from FirebaseUI to your app's target:
   ```
   FirebaseAuthUI
   FirebaseOAuthUI
   FirebaseGoogleAuthUI
   FirebasePhoneAuthUI
   ```

4. Add GoogleService-Info.plist file from your Firebase project. Read the [How to create Firebase Project](/resources/firebase-project) section to learn how to set it up.

<Warning>
Once you add the ChoicelyFirebase module to your app, you need to configure the Realtime Updates feature to work with it.
</Warning>
