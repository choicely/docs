The Choicely Android SDK provides an Ads module for integrating Google Ads (AdMob) into your mobile application.

## Why Ads?

- **Monetization** – Generate revenue by showing banner ads, interstitials, or rewarded ads in your app.
- **Google AdMob Integration** – Powered by Google's official mobile ads SDK for high-quality and relevant ad delivery.
- **Flexible Formats** – Support for multiple ad formats such as native ads, banners, and rewarded ads to maximize user engagement.

<Note>
Ads must be configured in your Google AdMob account before they can be displayed in your application.
</Note>
