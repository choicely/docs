Follow these steps to set up Firebase in your project with the Choicely Android SDK.

Firebase is required to enable certain features in the Choicely Android SDK.

## Why Firebase?

- **Push Notifications** – Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) allows the app to send push notifications directly to users, helping you keep them engaged with instant updates, news, or alerts.
- **Realtime Updates** – With Firebase Realtime Database, content and configuration changes can be delivered instantly to your users without requiring an app update. This ensures your app always reflects the latest data.
- **Social Login** – The Choicely SDK integrates with Firebase Authentication to enable sign-in with popular providers such as Google, Facebook, and Apple. This makes it easy for users to log in without creating a separate account.

## Gradle Setup

Add the Firebase dependency and plugin configuration in your `build.gradle` files.

### 1. Add Dependency

```gradle
implementation(platform("com.choicely.sdk:bom:1.1.0"))
implementation("com.choicely.sdk:android-core")
implementation("com.choicely.sdk:android-firebase")
```

### 2. Add Plugin in App-level build.gradle

```gradle
plugins {
    id("com.google.gms.google-services")
}
```

### 3. Add Plugin in Project-level build.gradle

```gradle
plugins {
    ...
    id("com.google.gms.google-services") version "4.4.3" apply false
}
```
