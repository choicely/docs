The Choicely Android SDK provides a Shop module for handling in-app purchases, subscriptions, and paid votes directly inside your application.

## Why Shop?

- **In-App Purchases** – Allow users to buy items, upgrades, or digital content inside your app.
- **Subscriptions** – Offer recurring subscription plans to give users ongoing access to premium features or content.
- **Paid Votes** – Monetize voting by enabling users to purchase voting credits, which can be used in competitions or polls.

<Note>
Shop features must be enabled first in your Choicely project before they can be used in your app.
</Note>

## Gradle Setup

Add the Choicely Shop SDK dependency in your `build.gradle` file.

```gradle
implementation(platform("com.choicely.sdk:bom:1.0.5"))
implementation("com.choicely.sdk:android-core")
implementation("com.choicely.sdk:android-shop")
```

## Shop Configuration

Initialize the Shop module in your `Application` class after setting up the Choicely SDK.
