To integrate Google Play with the Choicely Shop SDK, you need to create a Service Account in the Google Cloud Console and enable the required APIs.

## Why Service Account?

- **Secure Communication** – Allows Choicely Platform and your app to access Google Play Developer APIs safely.
- **Automated Reporting** – Enables fetching purchase and subscription data.

<Note>
You must have **Admin** or **Owner** access to the Google Play Console project to perform these steps.
</Note>

## Steps to Create Service Account

1. **Enable APIs:** Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), navigate to **APIs & Services → Library**, and enable the following:
   - Google Play Developer API
   - Google Play Developer Reporting API

2. **Create Service Account:** In the **Google Cloud Console → IAM & Admin → Service Accounts**, click **Create Service Account** and provide:
   - Service account name
   - Service account ID
   - Description (optional)

3. **Grant Access:** Assign the role **Service Account User**, then click **Done**.

4. **Create Key:** Open the newly created service account, go to the **Keys** tab, click **Add Key → JSON**. This will download a JSON credentials file.

   <Warning>
   Keep this file secure – it contains sensitive credentials.
   </Warning>

5. **Link to Play Console:** Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/), open **Setup → API access**, and link the Service Account to your project.
